# Part 5

## Site Changes
I optimized the hamburger menu for my portfolio on mobile devices' view by adding an animation that was purely designed by myself. I got inspiration from my friend's website.

I also fixed the structure of the skills page a little bit to address the offset in x axis when viewing it on mobile devices. Now the margin on the left and right looks much better.

In addition, I felt that the picture in Contact Me page on mobile view is kind of redundant there, so I removed it for a better user experience.

Last but not least, I modified some images' alt to make them more descriptive, and I added `loading=lazy` to some images that won't show up when the page is loading.

## 3rd Party Script
1. I first added Google Analytics for tracking in all of my pages so that I can better understand what pages got view most often.
2. I then added Fast Click script for the mobile devices' view. This script mitigate the latency of onclick event on phones, which allows users to have a smoother experience when they are viewing the website on their phone.
3. Lastly, I added Scroll Reveal script for my skills page. This provides a very nice animation when users are scrolling down the page that contains a lot of images.
