Extra Credit GitHub: https://github.com/willwen96/hw5-react

Note: you can navigate to HW5 by clicking the hw5 button in index.html. For the extra credit task, I first thought that we need to use frameworks for our portfolio page, so I rebuilded my website in React rather than Parts 1&2. But I also created a extracredit.js that contains link to these two parts in another project. Hope this can satisfy the requirements.
